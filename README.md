This is a fluid simulation uisng SPH with particles. 
It is based of the following papers -

Moreover It is expected that you have GLUT and GLEW libraries. 





Their setup can be found in the folliwing video:

It runs best using x86 although it can run on x64 as well.

Currently I making a GPU version of this using CUDA.
